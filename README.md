  > 1. Find out what your current values are, and rank them in order of importance.
  > 2. Ask yourself a new question: “What do my values need to be in order to achieve the destiny I desire and deserve?”  Brainstorm out a list.  Put them in order.  See which values you might get rid of and which values you might add in order to create the quality of life you truly want.

  > The root of behavior change and building better habits is your identity. Each action you perform is driven by the fundamental belief that it is possible. So if you change your identity (the type of person that you believe that you are), then it’s easier to change your actions.

  > Is it a core value?  It has certainly driven me.  But it’s not who I want to be.  It’s not who I believe God made me to be.  It’s certainly not an ideal I aspire to!  What do I do?

  > How Can You Find the Value Behind the Shadow?
  > 
  > 1.  Name The Shadow.  Identify the core value or motivation that has shown up as a theme in your life that doesn’t seem positive. (i.e. needing to be liked.)  This will come up if you are doing an honest assessment process looking for your authentic core values.  (Here’s how.)
  > 2.  Identify The Need.  Reflect on the shadow you’ve uncovered, and what need that motivation fills for you.  In my case, the drive to be liked was a way of being included.  The need behind it was to belong.
  > 3.  Reframe the Value.  Every healthy need in us comes from a positive value.  Think about the need you have, and what positive value might lie behind that need.  My need to belong pointed toward a value on safe, inclusive community.
  > 4.  Ask if it Resonates.  Look at your story and decide if this positive value has been a part of your life and resonates with you now.  If it doesn’t, then go back to step 3 and dig deeper.  When you find a positive value that resonates, you can use this new positive value to reframe the negative motivation.  Once it’s restated in this way, you have an authentic value that can help you as you think about your future.

  > So, here’s the catch: sitting around thinking about better values to have is nice. But nothing will solidify until you go out and embody that new value. Values are won and lost through life experience. Not through logic or feelings or even beliefs. They have to be lived and experienced to stick.

  > The five steps to changing people’s values and beliefs: the affective domain in action
  > 1. Engage people in discussion: Get people’s opinions about things (not regurgitating facts but what they think about the evidence). Opinions are the windows to our values and beliefs.  The idea is to get them to receive and respond (affective domain).
  > 2. Challenge people’s opinions (assumptions, beliefs, emotional reactions and thinking) and get them to work out what they are based on. the idea is to provoke a response and develop a weighing of the evidence and their values
  > 3. Provide the 1) evidence 2) tools and 3) techniques of challenge and critical thinking. Especially in the context of the situation or using real life cases.
  > 4. Give constant feedback about their critical thinking and use of the evidence, tools and techniques through the medium of their opinions.
  > 5. But first become an ‘educated’ critical thinker yourself….about yourself and your own values, beliefs, emotional reactions and opinions…
