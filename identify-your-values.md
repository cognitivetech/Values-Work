# Identify your values

* [How To Identify Your Real Core Values](https://marcalanschelske.com/identify-real-core-values/)
  > Your authentic core values are embedded in the important choices and turning points in your life. In a journal, start brainstorming a list of the major decisions that you’ve made. Start today, and work backwards as far as you can remember. Include things like:
  > 
  > - Big decisions you made.
  > - Traumatic experiences and how you responded.
  > - Critical points of transition in major relationships and why you think things went that way.

## Theory of basic human values

Universal values to more readily identify and align with those you wish to adopt.

> The theory of basic human values is a theory of cross-cultural psychology and universal values that was developed by Shalom H. Schwartz - [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_basic_human_values)

#### 10 Core Values - Tests
* [THE SHORT SCHWARTZ’S VALUE SURVEY](https://www.framevoicereport.org/media/1093/the-short-schwartzs-value-survey.pdf)
  > This short value scale is a shortened version of Schwartz’s Value Survey (SVS), which includes 57 value items that represent ten motivationally distinct values. The Short Schwartz's Value Survey gives insight in the ten broad values, not in the 57 specific values
* [PVQ Test - Portrait Values Questionnaire](https://aidaform.com/templates/pvq-test.html)
  > The Portrait Values Questionnaire (PVQ) is based on the concept of portrait values developed by social psychologist Shalom Schwartz in the late 80s. This PVQ was designed in 2001 and portrait values are taken from optimistminds.com/pvq/. The respondent is asked to compare themself with short descriptions of 40 different people and answer how similar they think they are to the portrait provided ranging from “very much like me” to “not like me at all.”

  > **The Schwartz Model of Values**\
  > Schwartz (1994) defined values as “transsituational goals, varying in importance, that serve as guiding principles in the life of a person or other social entity” (p. 21). He elaborated on this definition by specifying seven characteristics of values explicitly or implicitly found in most psychological models of values (Schwartz, 2016):
  > 1. Values are beliefs about the importance of desirable goals.
  > 2. When activated, values elicit emotion.3.Values are basic goals that apply across specific situations. 
  > 4. Values consciously or unconsciously motivate behavior, perception, and attitudes.
  > 5. Value effects occur through a process of trade-offs among the relevant values.
  > 6. Values serve as standards for evaluating actions, people, and events.
  > 7. Values are ordered by importance in a relatively enduring hierarchical system.

  > We saw some merging of socially oriented values, which may suggest that these values are less clearly differentiated at a linguistic level or alternatively, this mixing may reflect underlying universal human motivations. We outline some possible applications of our findings for both applications of ChatGPT for corporate usage and policy making as well as future research avenues. We also highlight possible implications of this relatively high-fidelity replication of motivational content using a linguistic model for the theorizing about human values.
