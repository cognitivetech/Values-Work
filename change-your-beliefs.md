# Changing Core Beliefs

Our values are directly connected to our beliefs. If you want to have and uphold proper values, you must also concern yourself with your beliefs.

  >  Limiting beliefs, in most cases, are unconscious thoughts, which appear as defence mechanisms to avoid possible frustrations, failure and disappointment. At a time in the past, you may have suffered from something specific, and now when you come face-to-face with a similar situation, your subconscious finds a way to try to block it. A good starting exercise to counteract limiting beliefs is to look for the root of the problem by finding the agent causing such negativity.

  > The third step entails challenging these beliefs. This includes a deliberate attempt at cognitive restructuring, identifying the cognitive distortions that are at work in our ANTs [Automatic Negative Thoughts], and patiently amassing evidence that contradicts our beliefs until we can accept that they no longer serve us and let them go ([Burns](https://github.com/cognitivetech/David-Burns-Feeling-Good-TEAM-CBT), 1980).
  > 
  > ANTs have been graced with much empirical and clinical attention, significantly more so than negative core beliefs, despite their crucial importance (David, Lynn, & Ellis, 2010). But given that ANTs can be the guides that lead us to our negative core beliefs, it is a great idea to use them as a starting point for identifying and then dealing with our more deep-seated negative beliefs.

  > Simple Steps [1-7]
  > 01. Choose the area of your life where you want to make a change. What area would make the biggest impact on your life?
  > 02. Write down all of your beliefs in that area. Think back to your childhood and what you picked up as a child from your parents, friends, teachers and others who had an impact in your formative years. What did you observe and hear repeatedly?
  > 03. Decide what core belief you want to change. Only choose one. Of all the beliefs you wrote down in step 2, which one would have the biggest impact on your life if you changed it to something more positive?
  > 04. Write down why it’s so important for you to change this belief. Until your reason to change is stronger than your reason to stay the same, it’s fruitless to fool yourself into thinking you can change such strongly held beliefs. How has it damaged you in the past and what’s possible in your future if you make the change? Without a “why” that matters deeply to you, any change is short-lived.
  > 05. Argue with this belief. Pretend that a friend holds this belief and you can’t believe they could be so dumb as to believe this. Show them all the evidence to the contrary. Show them how damaging this belief has been. Whenever they defend their belief, come up with more reasons why it’s false.
  > 06. Create a new, positive, more empowering belief. It will probably be the opposite of the belief you’re trying to change.
  > 07. Visualize your life in detail when you’ve changed your old belief into the new one. What’s now possible for you? Now that you’ve taken down the old perceived walls, where will you go and what do you see yourself doing? How do you feel now that you’re living the life you previously thought impossible?
  > 08. Every day, as you wake up, as you go to sleep and as often during the day as you can, repeat your new belief (preferably out loud) and feel the feelings you experienced in step 7. Feeling those new feelings on a regular basis is one of the most important aspects of this change process.
  > 09. Every day, at the end of the day, write down one to three things, large or small, that you will do the following day to disprove the old belief and reinforce the new belief and move you closer to the life you envisioned in step 7.
  > 10. The next day, do what you wrote down the night before as soon as you can. Action is incredibly powerful. Ideas, thoughts, and beliefs can swim around in your head creating havoc or heaven. Nothing will reinforce what you’re capable of more powerfully than taking action.

  > To find our core beliefs, we must be aware of what upsets us. Whenever we get upset at something, we have an excellent opportunity to find out what is hidden in our subconscious mind.

  > Simply put, when you find yourself getting upset, do these two things:
  > 1. Notice what is upsetting you.
  > 2. Pause for some moments and begin questioning the reasons that are making you upset.

  > All sounding a bit heavy? You can lighten the mood with core belief work by trying a bit of perspective changing. This means you take the core belief you’ve discovered and see it from completely different angles. What would this belief look like to you if you were a famous star? If you were on your death bed? If you were back to being your innocent two year old self? For example, if you were a famous star and walked into your workplace right now, would you think you were worthless? Would your dying self really care what your colleagues thought? Wouldn’t your two year old self think it strange that you only think you have worth in relation to a job?

  > Some say looking at what we “don’t want” isn’t a helpful practice (Abraham and Mike Dooley included), but despite that advice, I know many of us have had the experience that bringing something to light – just becoming aware of it – dissipates it!  It’s like the conscious light of day poofs it away.

  > Core beliefs are very subjective, which means they cannot easily be tested or proven. We can, however, test the rules that derive from it. Core beliefs almost always result in rules by which we live our lives. Most of these rules are self-protective – they are designed to help us avoid pain, trouble and catastrophe.

  > First, choose a core belief you want to change. Then focus on one of the rules that is dictated by that belief.

  > If we want any chance at persuasion, we must offer them happily. A weapon is an ugly thing, designed to frighten and coerce. A gift is something we believe to be good for the recipient, who, we hope, may accept it voluntarily, and do so with gratitude. That requires that we present it with love, not insults and hatred. Here are three steps to make this easier.
